						What's Happening
					<!-- </div> -->
				</h2>
				<p>Last year, 2,285 web accessibility cases were filed in the US. That's about six cases a day, and it's almost
					three times as many cases as 2017.<a class="footnote-reference" href="#fn-1" id="fn-ref-1"><span
							class="screenreader"> Go to footnote </span><sup>[1]</sup></a> As the number of cases rises, so too does
					the media attention, and no case has quite stolen that spotlight like <i>Robles v. Domino's Pizza</i> has.</p>
				<p>Guillermo Robles has had a storied three years. As a blind man who navigates the web using a screenreader, he
					found he was unable to order pizza from Domino's. He filed a suit against Domino's in September 2016, alleging
					that Domino's website and mobile app were incompatible with his screenreader. The Central District of California
					dismissed the case on the grounds that the law was not concrete enough to hold Domino's accountable. The Ninth
					Circuit Court of Appeals overturned that dismissal in January 2019, asserting that the law does, in fact, hold
					the pizza chain accountable for inaccessible websites and apps. Most recently, in July, Domino's petitioned to
					bring the case to the Supreme Court. They're backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Restaurant Law Center,
					and the National Retail Federation.<a class="footnote-reference" href="#fn-2" id="fn-ref-2"><span
							class="screenreader"> Go to footnote </span><sup>[2]</sup></a> Businesses really, really want to see
					this case go their way.</p>
				<p>This case could have a lasting impact for many disabled users of the internet. The Supreme Court has not yet seen
					a web accessibility case, meaning lower courts have been left to figure this out for themselves. Specifically,
					courts have been grappling with two big questions:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Does American law require websites to be accessible?</li>
					<li>If so, which standards of accessibility are websites held to?</li>
				</ol>
				<p>The courts' many responses to those questions have led to a lot of confusion, ambiguity, and frustration.
					However, understanding where these courts are coming from is vital to understanding the future of disabled
					users' access to the internet.</p>
				<p>Let's look at that first question:</p>

						Does the Law Require Web Accessibility?
					<!-- </div> -->
				</h2>
				<p>No federal law mentions web accessibility. As a result, courts turn to the next best thing: the Americans with
					Disabilities Act. <a href="https://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.htm#SubchapIII">Title III of the ADA</a>
					forbids public accommodations from discriminating against disabled Americans:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>"No individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of
						the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public
						accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation."
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Disabled plaintiffs argue that websites count as public accommodations and, as a result, cannot be inaccessible.

						Opinion #1: Yes, Websites Are Public Accommodations
					<!-- </div> -->
				</h4>
				<p>Amongst courts, the opinion that websites are inherently public accommodations is the most fringe. These courts,
					namely the First and Seventh Circuit Courts of Appeals, maintain that websites are public accommodations just by
					virtue of providing a service.</p>
				<p>The courts argue that there is precedent for nonphysical spaces counting as public accommodations. They wipe the
					dust off an old case, ADA-wise: the <i>Carparts Distribution Center, Inc. v. Automotive Wholesaler's Association
						of New England</i> case from 1994. In <i>Carparts</i>, the First Circuit ruled that the ADA covered
					phone-based services. They noted that Congress had included travel services in the list of example public
					accommodations. At the time, the travel services industry was largely telephone-based, so the First Circuit
					reasoned that <em>obviously</em> Congress intended to include nonphysical spaces such as telephone lines.</p>
				<p>In their <i>Carparts</i> ruling, the First Circuit noted that:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p class="quote-contents">"It would be irrational to conclude that persons who enter an office to purchase
						services are protected by the ADA, but persons who purchase the same services over the telephone or by mail
						are not. Congress could not have intended such an absurd result."</p><cite

									Ctr. v. Automotive Wholesaler's Ass'n.</a></i></span></cite>
				</blockquote>
				<p>The Seventh Circuit court has applied this reasoning to an insurance company that sold its services online:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p class="quote-contents">"The defendant asks us to interpret 'public accommodation' literally, as denoting a
						physical site, such as a store or a hotel, but we have already rejected that interpretation. An insurance
						company can no more refuse to sell a policy to a disabled person over the Internet than a furniture store

						Opinion #2: No, Websites Are Not Public Accommodations
					<!-- </div> -->
				</h4>
				<p>If the First Circuit's <i>Carparts</i> ruling seems like a bit of a stretch to you, you're not alone.</p>
				<p>Courts of this opinion, such as the Third, Fifth, and Sixth Circuit Courts, point to the ADA's full wording:
					"<strong>place</strong> of public accommodation." Nonphysical spaces such as websites, they argue, aren't
					places, and therefore they aren't covered by Title III. To claim that they are covered would be to vastly expand
					the scope of the law:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p class="quote-contents">"Here, to fall within the scope of the ADA as presently drafted, a public
						accommodation must be a physical, concrete structure. To expand the ADA to cover 'virtual' spaces would be
						to create new rights without well-defined standards."</p><cite class="quote-attribution"><span>District

				</blockquote>
				<p><em>Full disclosure: the Southern District of Florida actually sided with Opinion #3 in the Southwest Airlines
						case. This line just happens to be a very succinct explanation of Opinion #2.</em></p>
				<p>These courts often explicitly reject the <i>Carparts</i> ruling as an overreach:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p class="quote-contents">"In arriving at this conclusion, the First Circuit disregarded the statutory canon of
						construction, <i>noscitur a sociis</i>. <i>[...]</i> The doctrine of <i>noscitur a sociis</i> instructs that
						'a ... term is interpreted within the context of the accompanying words 'to avoid the giving of unintended
						breadth to the Acts of Congress.'' <i>[...]</i> The clear connotation of the words in § 12181(7) <i>[the
							list of examples of public accommodations]</i> is that a public accommodation is a physical place. Every
						term listed in § 12181(7) and subsection (F) is a physical place open to public access."</p><cite

				<p>Other cases that have made similar arguments and have been used as precedents within these courts include <a

				<p>Additionally, the ADA has been amended several times since the rise of the internet. If Congress really did
					intend for the ADA to cover nonphysical spaces such as websites, surely they would have included that in one of
					the amendments, right?<a class="footnote-reference" href="#fn-4" id="fn-ref-4"><span class="screenreader"> Go to

						Opinion #3: Websites Are <em>Sometimes</em> Public Accommodations

				</h4>
				<p>The most frequent court opinion about websites as public accommodations kind of sidesteps the question altogether

				<blockquote>

				<p>This is the principle of <dfn>nexus</dfn>: if a website has a significant connection to the goods and services
					offered by a physical public accommodation, then the website is seen as an extension of the public
					accommodation. In that case, it would be subject to Title III. After all, Title III forbids obstructing access
					to the goods and services "<strong>of</strong> any place of public accommodation," not "<strong>in</strong> any
					place of public accommodation."</p>
				<p>The first federal trial on web accessibility to be carried out in full was <a
						href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6744502269111605689"><i>Gil v. Winn-Dixie</i></a> in
					2017. Winn-Dixie offered digital coupons on their website that were only redeemable in their brick-and-mortar
					stores. Additionally, Winn-Dixie gave customers the option to refill their prescriptions online, but the refills
					also had to be picked up in-store. The Southern District of Florida determined that the Winn-Dixie website
					therefore had a nexus to the brick-and-mortar franchises. Thus, the website's incompatibility with screenreaders
					was a violation of the ADA.<a class="footnote-reference" href="#fn-5" id="fn-ref-5"><span class="screenreader">

				<p>Nexus does go the other way. In <a
						href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13814511373260202940"><i>Earll v. eBay, Inc.</i></a>, for
					instance, a deaf plaintiff sued eBay since she couldn't use the site's phone-based vendor verification service.
					The Ninth Circuit determined that, since eBay doesn't have any consumer-facing, brick-and-mortar locations, eBay
					is not a public accommodation and is not subject to Title III.<a class="footnote-reference" href="#fn-6"

					January when overturning the district court's dismissal of Robles's case:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p class="quote-contents">"Domino's website and app facilitate access to the goods and services of a place of

				<p>The <i>Robles v. Domino's Pizza</i> case is just one of many court cases centered around whether American law
					requires websites to be accessible. The number of web accessibility-related lawsuits is only going to go up from
					here as courts continue to give mixed opinions on the matter.</p>
				<p>By appealing the Ninth Circuit's decision, Domino’s Pizza is giving the Supreme Court the opportunity to affirm,
					finally, whether websites are inherently public accommodations, whether they're inherently <em>not</em> public
					accommodations, or whether they count as public accommodations if a nexus is present.</p>
				<p>However, while the question of whether the ADA covers websites is important, it's not the only question Domino's
					is contesting. Stick around for Part 2, where we'll cover magic checklists and due process.</p>
